# ChIA-drop Data Analysis in R - Multiplex chromatin interactions with single-molecule precision

Code for the analysis of ChIA-Drop data with ab immnuprecititation (e.g. CTCF or H3K4me1). It process paired-end FASTQ data and creates a list of multi-contacts that represent chromatin interactions at single molecule resolution.
